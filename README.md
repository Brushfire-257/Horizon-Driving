# Horizon Driving

## Buckle Up for High-Speed Action!

Welcome to **Horizon Driving** – my _masterpiece✨_ - an adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced arcade game where you take the wheel and dive into intense chases. Evade traffic, outmaneuver the cops, and unleash your driving skills on a road where speed is your only ally. With multiple cars to choose from and slick animations that bring the menus to life, Horizon Driving is the dream game I have wanted to make for a long time :)

### Awesome Features
